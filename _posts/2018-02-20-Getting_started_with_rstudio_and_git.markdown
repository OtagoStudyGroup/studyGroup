title: Getting started with RStudio and Git
text: Our first Otago Study Group session of the year aims to get everyone up and running with RStudio and GitHub integration, and able to communicate via the popular team messaging application, Slack.  Before the meeting we’ll post a link to a GitHub repository containing the code and files for the lesson so that you can follow along. Prior to Tuesday, it would be great if everyone could have a look at Section 3.1 from\:

http\://happygitwithr.com/workshops.html#pre-workshop-set-up

and see how far you can get along the road to "Prove RStudio can find local Git” (the last bullet point in Section 3.1).  For those of you that have completed the Software Carpentry sessions on Git, you will hopefully already have a working Git installation (and a GitHub account), and thus already be some way through the checklist.  If you run into trouble, don’t worry - that's what Study Group is for!
