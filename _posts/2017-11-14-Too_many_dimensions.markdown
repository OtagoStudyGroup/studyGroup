title: Too many dimensions - dimension reduction techniques with Mik
text:  PCA (principal components analysis), SVD (singular value decomposition) and MDS (multi-dimensional scaling) - how they work (and how they are basically all the same thing under certain situations), how we use them for dimension reduction (including for ancestry/relatedness correction), and how we can use the rsvd package to calculate the SVD really fast.
