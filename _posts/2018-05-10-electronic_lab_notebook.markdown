title: Electronic Lab Notebook using Markdown, GitHub and Hugo - a small step towards Open Science 
text: "Tired of re-explaining what you've been doing for the last 2 months to your supervisor(s)? 
Can't be bothered to keep your physical lab notebook clean and organised? 
Want to easily share your newest methods and results with your colleagues/students?
 
Look no further - In this session, we will present a couple of ways one can implement a shareable open/closed Electronic Lab Notebook using Markdown, Git/GitHub and Hugo.
This brief presentation is aimed to open up a discussion on how we can improve reproducibility of our research, better communicate our work with others, and try to ease the day-to-day mess students and/or supervisors have to put up with."
