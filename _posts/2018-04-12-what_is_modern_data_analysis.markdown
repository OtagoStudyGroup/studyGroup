title: What is modern data analysis? 
text: Machine learning has arguably supplanted classical statistics in many applied situations, and yet is hardly taught in many institutions. This talk is an introduction to modern approaches to data analysis, for people who still think p < 0.05 is the goal of research. Although several new methods will be covered, the talk is not a how-to or selling of those methods, rather an illustration to an approach to quantitative research that is seldom demonstrated or taught.
